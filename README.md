# An Analytical Approach to Dynamic Window Views and Visual Attention Through Image Processing Techniques

## Description
The primary aim of this project is to refine and enhance a novel framework previously established. This framework focuses on analyzing the dynamics and movement observed in window views from real-time video footage. The goal is to evolve this framework into a reproducible repository and/or application that can be widely utilized. A key objective is to integrate this enhanced methodology with behavioral data obtained from eye-tracking studies. By doing so, we aim to investigate the impact of movement within window views on human visual attention. The project intends to analyze existing gaze data and movement analysis methodologies to decipher the attentional importance of dynamics observed through window views. Furthermore, we plan to leverage deep learning and/or neural network technologies to develop predictive models that can forecast attentional responses based on window view dynamics. All methods should be developed for efficient analysis of large sets of videos and validated in a systematic research and development process. The final project outcome should be a working implementation of the developed methods, together with a written thesis report documenting the research and development process.
